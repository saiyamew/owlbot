Owlbot

Owlbot Discord Bot - used to summon owls!

This originated because UB3R-BOT's .owl command was broken - the API at http://pics.floofybot.moe is evidently dead. So I decided to try to make an Owl API to replace it!

That happened (see owl-o-rama project), but none of the existing Discord bots could run it. So I cobbled a Discord Bot together from a few tutorials and... voila!
Owlbot, which summons Owls from the Owl-O-Rama.
